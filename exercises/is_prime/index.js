// Define a function called is_prime that takes a number x as input.
// For each number n from 2 to x - 1, test if x is evenly divisible by n.
// If it is, return false.
// If none of them are, then return true
// A prime number is a positive integer greater 
// than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
