// There are 3 types of edits that can be perfromed on a string: 
// insert a char, remove a char, or replace a char. Given two strings,
// write a function to check if they are 1 or 0 edits away.

// This is one of those problems where it's helpful to think about
// to think about the meaning of each of these operations. What
// does it mean for 2 strings to be one insertion, removal, or 
// replacement away from each other?
